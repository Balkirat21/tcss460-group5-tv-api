HOW TO AUTHORIZE IN SWAGGER UI
========================================

PROBLEM:
You're getting 401 errors when trying to use PUT or any endpoint in Swagger UI.

REASON:
Swagger UI doesn't automatically send the API key. You need to manually authorize.

SOLUTION - STEP BY STEP:
========================================

STEP 1: Open Swagger UI
   - Go to: http://localhost:3000/api-docs

STEP 2: Click the "Authorize" Button
   - Look for the GREEN button at the top-right
   - Text says: "🔒 Authorize"
   - Click it!

STEP 3: Fill in the API Key
   - You'll see a popup window
   - It has a text field labeled "Value:"
   - Type exactly: 1234
   - Do NOT type: "1234" (without quotes)
   - Just the number: 1234

STEP 4: Click "Authorize"
   - Click the green "Authorize" button in the popup
   - Then click "Close"

STEP 5: Test Again
   - Now try your PUT request
   - It should work!

VISUAL GUIDE:
========================================
Before authorizing:
[🔒 Authorize]  ← Click this button

After clicking, popup appears:
┌────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ApiKeyAuth                        │
│                                    │
│ Value: [1234              ]        │
│        ↑ Type your API key here    │
│                                    │
│ [Authorize]  [Close]              │
└────────────────────────────────────┘

After authorizing:
✅ api_key (ApiKeyAuth)
  show  ← Click to see your key

========================================

ALTERNATIVE: Use test-api.html instead!
- This file automatically includes the API key
- No authorization needed
- Just open it and click "Execute"

To open test-api.html:
1. Find the file test-api.html in your project
2. Double-click to open in browser
3. Or type in terminal: open test-api.html

========================================

YOUR API KEY: 1234
YOUR SERVER: http://localhost:3000

Everything else is working perfectly!
The only issue is that Swagger UI requires manual authorization.
